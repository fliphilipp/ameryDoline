# Rapid formation of an ice doline on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica

Key Points:
- Satellite data showed ~60 km2 of Amery Ice Shelf deform as an englacial lake of 0.75 km3 drained abruptly in winter forming an ice doline
- ICESat-2 repeat tracks and WorldView DEMs showed the central surface elevation fell as much as 80 m, with over 30 m of surrounding uplift
- ICESat-2 photon data showed a new meltwater channel, incised as a lake formed by flexural uplift overflowed into the doline in 2020

Plain Language Summary:

Surface melting over Antarctica’s floating ice shelves is predicted to increase significantly during coming decades, but the implications for their stability are unknown. The Antarctic Peninsula has already seen meltwater driven ice shelf collapses. We are still learning how meltwater forms, flows and alters the surface, and that rapid water-driven changes are not limited to summer. We present high-resolution satellite data (imagery and altimetry) showing an abrupt change on East Antarctica’s Amery Ice Shelf in June 2019 (midwinter). A 20 km2 ice-covered meltwater lake drained through to the ocean below, leaving a deep, uneven 11 km2 depression of fractured ice (a “doline”) in the ice shelf surface. The reduced load on the floating ice resulted in flexure, with uplift of up to 36 m around the former lake. Using an elastic flexure model, we showed that this corresponds to about 0.75 km3 of water being lost to the ocean. ICESat-2 observations in summer 2020 profiled a new narrow channel inside the doline as meltwater started refilling it from a new lake created by the flexure. ICESat-2’s capacity to observe surface processes at small spatial scales greatly improves our ability to model them, ultimately improving the accuracy of our projections.
